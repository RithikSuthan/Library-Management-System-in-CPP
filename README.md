# Library Management System (LMS)

## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to efficiently manage the operations of a library, including adding, updating, deleting, and searching for books. The system utilizes binary files for data storage, ensuring fast and efficient access to library records.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing library resources.
- **Binary File Storage:** Utilizes binary files to store library data, providing efficient data access and retrieval.
- **Book Management:** Allows librarians to add new books, update existing book information, delete books, and search for books by various criteria.
- **User Management:** Enables librarians to manage user accounts, including adding new users, updating user information, and deleting user accounts.
- **Transaction History:** Tracks transaction history, including book borrowings, returns, and fines.

## Implementation
- **File Handling:** Implements file handling operations in C++ to read from and write to binary files for storing library data.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizes appropriate data structures such as arrays, structures, and linked lists to organize and manage library records efficiently.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to interact with the system, facilitating easy navigation and operation.

## Functionality
